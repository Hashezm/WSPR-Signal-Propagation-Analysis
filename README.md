## Analysis and Results
### Data Cleaning
Performed data imputation on numerical columns to handle missing values.

### Summary Statistics
Generated summary statistics for all numerical columns to understand data distribution and detect outliers.

### Unique Values Analysis
Counted unique values in `band`, `rx_sign`, and `tx_sign` columns.

### Distance Analysis
Calculated average distance between transmitting and receiving stations for signals with power less than 30 dBm.

### Frequency Analysis
Identified the receiving station with the most transmissions on the 14 MHz band.

## Modeling
### Data Partitioning
Randomly partitioned the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using the `createDataPartition()` function from the `caret` package.

### Linear Regression Model
Generated a linear regression model to predict the signal-to-noise ratio based on distance, frequency, and power.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluated the accuracy of the model using the testing data set and appropriate accuracy metrics. Discussed the performance and potential improvements.

## Conclusion
Summarized the findings from the analysis and modeling. Provided insights into the factors affecting WSPR signal propagation and the effectiveness of the predictive model.
